# General Research Strategies

## Source Selection Defaults
- **Opinion/experience questions**: Reddit first, then HN — real users > articles
- **Technical how-to**: Google + official docs, then Stack Overflow via Google
- **New announcements**: Google (news indexed fast), then official source directly
- **Troubleshooting**: Google with exact error string, then official forum with site: operator

## Query Patterns
- Include exact error messages in quotes for troubleshooting
- Add "vs" or "comparison" to trigger comparison content
- Add "reddit" to Google queries to surface Reddit results when reddit-search skill isn't finding good threads
- Use `site:` operator for known high-quality domains

## Sites to Generally Avoid
- SEO listicles ("Top 10 Best X in 2026") — affiliate marketing, not real reviews
- Content farms with no author bylines
- Sites that summarize other sites without adding insight
